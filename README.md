# emberon v2 ü¶ï
 Emberon, a weird tool I made for converting any file into a .png for some reason.

![logo](logo.jpeg)

 It is a Python tool that lets you hide any binary file inside a PNG image in a fully lossless way ‚Äî and later recover it perfectly.
 
 TESTED WITH:- .txt, .zip (more will be done later)
 
 It packs your file‚Äôs bytes directly into pixels, optionally compresses them, and stores integrity information so decoding is safe.
 
  Great for:
 - Sharing binary data via image-friendly platforms.
 - Preserving files inside an a png (archive type)
 - Piracy.
 
 FULL 150 PARAGRAPHS OF LOREM IPSUM LOOKS LIKE THIS: (original text and image is in repo)
 
 Encoded lorem_ipsum.txt (90195 bytes) -> lorem_ipsum_encoded2.png (78x78, 6084 pixels).
 Compression: zlib (orig 90195(~90kb) -> comp 24139(~24kb) bytes)

## commands üíæ
 
 ### Encoding images
 ```
 python3 emberon.py encode <filename> <output_png_name>.png
 ```
 ### Decoding images
 ```
 python3 emberon.py <encoded_file>.png <output_name>.extension_name
 ```
 ### Inspect (Important)
 ```
 python3 inspect <encoded_file>.png
 ```

---

## usage. üíΩ
 
 ### Encoding 
  See above for the actual command.
 
 ### Decoding
  You might want to use the 'inspect' command before decoding to ensure that .png is actually a valid .png file (check for b'EMBERONV2' in output)
 
  See above for the actual command
 
 ### Inspecting üîÆ
  *VERY* important new feture implemented in v2. 
 
  It gives: The MAGIC string (used by emberon to identify that the file was made by emberon), the compression method, original size, compressed size and the SHA-256 (along wiht the reserved tag)
 
  For example, this is the header information for encoded.png in the repo:
  ```MD
  [Header Information]
   Magic: b'EMBERON1'
   Compression: zlib
   Original size: 88.08 KB
   Compressed size: 23.57 KB
   SHA-256: abb5f85061b5860a88f9676aa31577179d4bd268ed9f489e9fac52e63434ab9f
   Reserved: 0
  ```
 
 ### Flags ü´•
  - -l', '--level' - Sets the zlib compression level (default: 6, range: 0 - 9)
  - --no-compress' - Completely skips zlib compression; stores the EXACT data you give it
 
  (note: setting --level 0 is practically the same as --no-compress, zlib doesn't compress data at level 0 BUT the zlib header/structure will be around the data.)

## Why YOU should you emberon üéÅ
 For sharing files and stuff with your friends.

 If you want to make a large digital archive

 Piracy.

 (Please avoid using this until v3, it's going to finalize th header structure.)

---

## features?? üîé
 - **Any file type** ‚Äî works with text, binaries, archives, executables, etc.
- **Lossless PNG output** ‚Äî original data is 100% preserved.
- **Optional zlib compression** for smaller images.
- **Built-in integrity check** (SHA-256).
- **Shows Error if image was changed**
- **Simple encode/decode commands**.
- **Near-square image dimensions** for practicality.

---

## What's New in Emberon v2 üéâ
- **Streaming encode/decode** ‚Äî handles very large files without loading them fully into RAM.  
- **PNG mode validation** ‚Äî ensures you only decode supported RGBA PNGs.  
- **Progress bars** ‚Äî visible encoding/decoding progress for large files.  
- **Colored CLI output** ‚Äî errors, warnings, and success messages are now color-coded.  
- **Human-readable sizes** ‚Äî file sizes shown in KB, MB, GB instead of raw bytes.  
- **Pretty header inspection** ‚Äî new `inspect` command to view header metadata without decoding.  

---

## Installation ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí•

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed.
2. Install Pillow, Tqdm, Colorama OR use req,txt >>

```bash
pip install -r req.txt
```
---

## future plans?? üì°
 piracy.

 Notations:
  - (!) - important/definitely/working on currently
  - (?) - maybe
  - (*) - planned, but later

 - Better errors & hints (!)
 - Alternate compression algorithms (!)
 - Configurable aspect ratio (!)
 - Automatic filename and extension (stored in header) (!)
 - Parallel chunk compression (*)
 - Encryption with AES-256 (*)
 - Checksum redundancy (*)
 - Multi-file support (?)
 - GUI fork (?)

## technical stuff. ‚öìÔ∏è (W.I.P)
 For the header:
 
 ```
 +-----------------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
 | Field           | Size     | Description                                 |
 +-----------------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
 | MAGIC           | 8 bytes  | Identifier + version (b'EMBERON1')          |
 | comp_method     | 1 byte   | Compression type (0=none, 1=zlib)           |
 | reserved        | 1 byte   | Reserved for future features                |
 | orig_size       | 8 bytes  | Original uncompressed file size (bytes)     |
 | comp_size       | 8 bytes  | Compressed data size (bytes)                |
 | sha256_digest   | 32 bytes | SHA-256 hash of "orig_size:data"            |
 +-----------------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
 TOTAL: 58 bytes (padded to 64 bytes in file)
