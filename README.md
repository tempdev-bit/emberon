# emberon v2.5 ü¶ï
 Emberon, a weird tool I made for converting **ANY** file into a .png for some reason.

![logo](logo.jpeg)

 It is a Python tool that lets you turn any binary file inside a PNG image in a fully lossless way ‚Äî and later recover it perfectly.
 
 TESTED WITH:- .txt, .zip, .AppImage (more will be done later)
 
 It packs your file‚Äôs bytes directly into pixels, optionally compresses them, and stores integrity information so decoding is safe.
 
  Great for:
 - Sharing binary data via image-friendly platforms.
 - Preserving files inside an a png (archive type)
 - Piracy.
 
 FULL 150 PARAGRAPHS OF LOREM IPSUM LOOKS LIKE THIS: (original text and image is in repo)
 
 Encoded lorem_ipsum.txt (90195 bytes) -> lorem_ipsum_encoded2.png (78x78, 6084 pixels).
 Compression: zlib (orig 90195(~90kb) -> comp 24139(~24kb) bytes)

## commands üíæ
 ### Simplified commands
  #### Encoding
    ```py
    # Encode lorem_ipsum.txt -> lorem_ipsum.txt.png
    python emberon.py e lorem_ipsum.txt
    ```

  #### Decoding
    ```py
   # Decode encoded.png -> original name inside header
   python emberon.py d file.zip.png
    ```

  #### Inspecting
  ```py
   # Inspect encoded.py
   python emberon.py i file.zip.png
  ```
  #### Output name
  uses the ``` -o ``` tag. </br>
  for example:</br>
  encoding ->
  ```py
   python emberon.py e lorem_ipsum.txt -o encoded.txt
  ```
  decoding ->
  ```py
  python emberon.py d file.zip.png
  ```
  
 ### Verbose commands
   #### Encoding images
   ```py
   python3 emberon.py encode <filename> <output_png_name>.png
   ```
   #### Decoding images
   ```py
   python3 emberon.py decode <encoded_file>.png <optional_output_filename>
   ```
   #### Inspect (Important)
 
   ```py
   python3 emberon.py inspect <encoded_file>.png
  ```
  ### flags.
   #### -l or --level
   used to set the level for compression algorithm (scale 0-9) (default:9)</br>
   the larger the level, the more time it will take, although still even at level 9, large files don't take much time.</br>
   USE LEVEL 9 FOR OPTIMIZATION'S SAKE

   #### --no-compress
   avoids compression entirely (why would you want to use this tbh)
  (note: setting --level 0 is practically the same as --no-compress, zlib doesn't compress data at level 0 BUT the zlib header/structure will be around the data.)
 
---

## size üíæ 
 Emberon provides three different compression algorithms. (zlib, zstd, lzma)</br>
 Here's all three compared for lorem_ipsum.txt (150 paargraphs) with MAX compression applied (lossless):

 1. Zlib: 
   ‚úì Encoded lorem_ipsum.txt -> encoded.png [79x78]
   Compression: zlib (orig **88.08** KB ‚Üí comp **23.57** KB)

 2. Zstd:
   ‚úì Encoded lorem_ipsum.txt -> encoded.png [78x77]
   Compression: zstd (orig **88.08** KB ‚Üí comp **23.12** KB)

 3. Lzma:
   ‚úì Encoded lorem_ipsum.txt -> encoded.png [74x74]
   Compression: lzma (orig **88.08** KB ‚Üí comp **21.09** KB)

 These results speak for themselves. </br>
 Lzma has the lowsert post-compress file size</br>
 BUT, CURRENTLY zstd is the default while both zlib and lzma anre optional by passing the "--zlib" and "--lzma" tags respectively.</br>
 I will be deciding the final compression library for v3 in a few days.

## usage. üíΩ
 
 ### Encoding 
  See above for the actual command. </br>
 
  Keywords: encode, e
 
  If no name is provided for output file, it will settle on <filename.extension>.png
 
 ### Decoding
  See above for the actual command </br>

  Keywords: decode, d

  You might want to use the 'inspect' command before decoding to ensure that .png is actually a valid .png file (check for b'EMBERONV3' in output) </br>
  You can pass a name for output file, which is completely optional. (it defaults the names to the original file which was compressed)

 ### Inspecting üîÆ
  *VERY* important new feture implemented in v2. 
 
  Keywords: inspect, i

  It gives: The MAGIC string (used by emberon to identify that the file was made by emberon), the compression method, original size, compressed size and the SHA-256 (along with the reserved tag)
 
  For example, this is the header information for encoded.png in the repo:

  ```py
  [Header Information]
   Magic: b'EMBERON3'
   Compression: zlib
   Original size: 88.08 KB
   Compressed size: 23.57 KB
   Original filename: lorem_ipsum.txt
   SHA-256: abb5f85061b5860a88f9676aa31577179d4bd268ed9f489e9fac52e63434ab9f
   Reserved: 0
  ```

## Why YOU should you emberon üéÅ
 For sharing files and stuff with your friends.

 If you want to make a large digital archive

 Piracy.

 (Please avoid using this until v3, it's going to finalize the header structure.)

## features?? üîé
 - **Any file type** ‚Äî works with text, binaries, archives, executables, etc.
 - **Lossless PNG output** ‚Äî original data is 100% preserved.
 - **Optional zlib compression** for smaller images.
 - **Built-in integrity check** (SHA-256).
 - **Shows Error if image was changed**
 - **Simple encode/decode commands**.
 - **Near-square image dimensions** for practicality.

## What's New in Emberon v2.5 ‚ú® (W.I.P)
 - **Original filename & extension storage**(Max length: 175; practical limit: 194) ‚Äî headers now store original file name and extension for automatic restoration on decode.
 - *(Note on above point: name_len and ext_len are stored in 2-byte unsigned shorts (max 65535),but practical limit is 190 bytes for filename if extension is ~4 bytes, due to 256-byte header.)*
 - **Automatic output naming** ‚Äî if no output filename is specified during decoding, Emberon uses the stored original name + extension.
 - **Expanded header format** ‚Äî header size increased to 256 bytes to accommodate filename metadata safely.
 - **Updated magic signature** ‚Äî changed from EMBERON2 ‚Üí EMBERON3 to avoid accidental decoding of older v2  files.
 - **Unified header parser** ‚Äî new parser function simplifies inspect and decode commands.
 - **Inspect mode enhancements** ‚Äî view original filename, extension, and other metadata without decoding.
 - **Safety checks for filename lengths** ‚Äî prevents oversized metadata from breaking PNG encoding.

## What's New in Emberon v2 üéâ
- **Streaming encode/decode** ‚Äî handles very large files without loading them fully into RAM.  
- **PNG mode validation** ‚Äî ensures you only decode supported RGBA PNGs.  
- **Progress bars** ‚Äî visible encoding/decoding progress for large files.  
- **Colored CLI output** ‚Äî errors, warnings, and success messages are now color-coded.  
- **Human-readable sizes** ‚Äî file sizes shown DYNAMICALLY in KB, MB, GB instead of raw bytes.  
- **Pretty header inspection** ‚Äî new `inspect` command to view header metadata without decoding.
